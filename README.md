# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

> Description

Fake News Detection is a machine learning project that identifies and classifies news articles as either **Fake News** or **True News**. The goal is to combat the spread of misinformation by leveraging machine learning techniques. 

This project uses datasets containing fake and true news articles, processes the data, and trains models to achieve high accuracy in detecting fake news. The models use text vectorization techniques like **TF-IDF** and algorithms such as Logistic Regression for classification.

> Features
  - Preprocessing text data by cleaning and tokenizing.
  - TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction.
  - Logistic Regression for classification with high accuracy.
  - Manual testing with real-time input to detect fake news.
  - Modular code structure for flexibility and easy updates.

> Dataset (True and Fake csv files given)
  - **Fake News Dataset**: Contains a collection of fake news articles.
  - **True News Dataset**: Contains verified news articles.
  - Downloaded from [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

> Libraries Used
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `re` (Regex)
  - `string`
  - `scikit-learn`

> Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following libraries are installed:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
